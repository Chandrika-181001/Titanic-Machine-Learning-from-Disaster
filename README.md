# Titanic-Machine-Learning-from-Disaster
Built a predictive model to determine survival likelihood using the Titanic dataset (Kaggle). Performed EDA, feature engineering, and applied models like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest. Used cross-validation and accuracy metrics, identifying key survival predictors: gender, class, and age.
